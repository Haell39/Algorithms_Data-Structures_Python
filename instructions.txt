steps to implement an algorithm

Big (O) Notatiom

   For linear search we have O(n) time completxity
   Binary search is O(log n)

Runtime per operation

    in linear search the the runtime is constant time that we called O(1) -> reading a value in a list is a constant time operation!

    there are also logarithimic time

    we also have quadritic time and cubic time

    quasi-linear runtime is O(n log n)
